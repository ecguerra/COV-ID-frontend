## User Stories
- As a user, I would like to be able to search and save location searches to my dashboard
- As a user, I would like to see infection rates and number of cases
- As a user, I would like to see historical as well as current data
- As a user, I would like my search history to be preserved so I can reference it later
- As a user, I would like to see locationsâ€™ past history as well as their current information when I search

## Technology used
- React
- Materialize
- React Router
- Material Table
- Chart.js
- Mapbox
- disease.sh
- Google API
- axios
- swr

## Installation Instructions
- download and install backend repo
- create an admin user in the backend
- download frontend repo and run npm i to install all dependencies
- with backend running, npm start the app
- create an account (or login as your admin), and start searching locations

## General Approach
We wanted to create an app that would be simple to navigate and would provide users with Covid-19 trends in their selected areas. There were already Covid-19 APIs available, and we discussed how we as users would want that information displayed. We decided charts to show historical data and maps to show global data and a dashboard to save the locations that are most relevant to the user.

## Stretch Goals
- [] International/Non-US Locations
- [] Mapbox zooming in when a search term is provided
- [] Formatting the Mapbox points (by color and/or size) based on the infection/death rates

## Major Hurdles
Mapbox. Mapbox was our biggest hurdle. The biggest challenge was probably because the Covid-19 API has different endpoints depending on the level of data you're looking for, so the endpoint has to dynamically change depending on the search terms.

Getting the site deployed on the front end was also a huge challenge. Some of the parts of the site would work, then they wouldn't. We tried both Surge and Netlify for hosting, but because those are primarily for static sites, the dynamic parts of our site would throw errors. Currently researching other options and workarounds.

## Acknowledgements
We used the following tutorials to troubleshoot our Mapbox problems:

And of course, thank you to our General Assembly instructors and IAs for the help and support (and many many office hours): Billie, Mateen, Khoury, and Fatima.
